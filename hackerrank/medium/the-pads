(SELECT CONCAT(NAME,"(",LEFT(OCCUPATION,1),")") FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY NAME ASC LIMIT 100)
UNION
(SELECT CONCAT("There are a total of ", COUNT(OCCUPATION)," ",LOWER(OCCUPATION),"s.") FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), LOWER(OCCUPATION) ASC LIMIT 100)

In the above solution LIMIT is used because if it is not provided even if the 2 subqueries produce sorted results,
after doing union, the result set is unsorted.
